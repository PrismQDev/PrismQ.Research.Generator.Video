## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Content Pitfalls

**Pitfall:** Weak hooks that lose viewers immediately
- **Solution:** Use proven hook formulas from prompt library
- **Example:** "You won't believe what my MIL did..." vs "So this happened..."

**Pitfall:** Too long for platform (TikTok especially)
- **Solution:** Aim for 30-45s maximum, use cliffhangers for series

**Pitfall:** Story doesn't match visual background
- **Solution:** Match mood (sad story = rain, victory = sunshine)

**Pitfall:** Over-explanation, slow pacing
- **Solution:** 160-180 words per minute, cut filler words

### Technical Pitfalls

**Pitfall:** Audio sync drift over time
- **Solution:** Use 48kHz sample rate, constant frame rate, don't mix rates

**Pitfall:** Interpolation artifacts (ghosting, blur)
- **Solution:** Use RIFE instead of FFmpeg, start with high-quality source

**Pitfall:** Captions not readable on mobile
- **Solution:** 70-90px font size, white with black outline, test on phone

**Pitfall:** File too large for upload
- **Solution:** Reduce bitrate to platform requirements, use H.265 if needed

### Strategy Pitfalls

**Pitfall:** Posting at wrong times
- **Solution:** Follow optimal posting times in research (7-10 PM EST for teens)

**Pitfall:** Inconsistent posting schedule
- **Solution:** Batch create, schedule in advance, maintain rhythm

**Pitfall:** Ignoring analytics
- **Solution:** Track completion rate, engagement, double down on what works

**Pitfall:** Copying competitors exactly
- **Solution:** Study for patterns, add unique voice, differentiate
