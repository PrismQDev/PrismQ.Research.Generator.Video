- Quality below top commercial models in some aspects
- Windows-primary development (Linux supported, macOS limited)

🔄 **Integration Potential with PrismQ**:
- **Ideal fit** for horror/true-crime narrative shorts
- Multi-keyframe I2V matches script → beats → video workflow
- Real-time drafts enable rapid creative iteration
- Temporal upscaler provides professional polish
- RTX 5090 hardware perfectly suited
- LTX-2 (future) will enable native VO sync for story content

### Final Assessment

For PrismQ.Research.Generator.Video's horror and true-crime short-form content, LTX-Video offers exceptional value:

1. **Speed**: Real-time iteration on RTX 5090 accelerates creative workflow
2. **Control**: Multi-keyframe I2V ensures consistent visual narrative across story beats
3. **Quality**: Professional-grade output with temporal upscalers
4. **Flexibility**: I2V from SDXL keyframes integrates with existing pipeline
5. **Cost**: No API fees, fully local deployment
6. **Future**: LTX-2 audio+video sync perfect for VO-driven content

**Recommendation**: **Proceed with immediate integration** for horror/true-crime content. LTX-Video's multi-keyframe I2V, combined with PrismQ's engagement optimization, creates a best-in-class system for AI-generated, retention-optimized short-form video.

The RTX 5090 hardware is perfectly matched to LTX-Video's real-time capabilities, enabling a rapid iterate-and-refine workflow that was previously impossible with slower generation models.

## Quick Start Guide for RTX 5090

### Recommended First Workflow

**Goal**: Generate a 4-5 second horror atmospheric clip

**Settings**:
- **Model**: 13B-distilled
- **Resolution**: 768×1344 (vertical)
- **Frames**: 129 (≈4.3 seconds @ 30fps)
- **Steps**: 8 (draft) or 12 (quality)
- **STG**: Enabled (0.7 strength)
- **Upscaler**: Temporal (optional, for final)

**Prompt Example**:
```
Slow dolly forward through abandoned Victorian hallway, dim flickering 
overhead lights, peeling wallpaper with dark floral patterns, shadows 
dancing on walls, handheld camera with subtle shake, desaturated blue-gray 
color palette with deep blacks, eerie silence, dust particles visible in 
light beams, increasing tension
```

**Expected Performance on RTX 5090**:
- Draft (8 steps): ~8-12 seconds
- Quality (12 steps): ~15-20 seconds
- With temporal upscaler: +10-15 seconds

**Next Steps**:
1. Generate draft to validate prompt and composition
2. Iterate on prompt if needed (fast turnaround)
3. Generate quality version when satisfied
4. Apply temporal upscaler for final polish
5. Import to PrismQ pipeline for engagement optimization
6. Add captions, progress bar, and platform-specific formatting
7. Export and upload

### Default Node Values for ComfyUI

**Sampling Settings**:
- Sampler: `euler` or `dpmpp_2m`
- Scheduler: `normal`
- Steps: 8 (draft), 12 (balanced), 20-30 (quality)
- CFG Scale: 7.0
- STG Strength: 0.7

**Q8 Quantization** (if VRAM constrained):
- Enables ~6-8GB VRAM operation
- Minimal quality loss
- Recommended for >129 frame generations on 12GB cards

**Tiling Settings** (for high-res):
- Tile size: 512 or 768
- Overlap: 128
- Use for resolutions >1024px any dimension

**Looping Sampler** (for long videos):
- Segment length: 129 frames
- Overlap frames: 16-32
- Blend mode: crossfade
- Use for sequences >257 frames
