### Optimization for RTX 5090

The RTX 5090 is a high-end GPU well-suited for LongCat-Video. Here are optimization tips:

**Memory Management:**
- RTX 5090 has ample VRAM for LongCat-Video's 13.6B parameters
- Use FP16 or mixed precision to reduce VRAM usage if needed:
  ```python
  # Add to your generation config
  torch.set_float32_matmul_precision('medium')
  ```
- Start with modest settings (128 frames at 720p) before scaling up

**Performance Optimization:**
- Use the `--enable_compile` flag for optimized kernels (torch.compile)
- Enable FlashAttention-2 for faster attention operations
- Tune batch size based on available VRAM (typically 1-2 for video generation)
- Monitor GPU utilization with `nvidia-smi -l 1`

**Vertical Video Generation (9:16 for Shorts/Reels/TikTok):**
- Target resolution: 1080×1920 (vertical format)
- If LongCat-Video generates horizontal by default, you may need to:
  - Generate at 720×1280 and upscale to 1080×1920
  - Crop/adjust aspect ratio in post-processing
  - Check model documentation for aspect ratio support
  
**Quality Settings:**
- Resolution: Start at 720×1280, upscale if needed
- Frame count: 128-256 frames for 4-8 second clips at 30fps
- Inference steps: 50-100 for quality vs. speed balance
- Reduce spatial resolution or frame count if hitting VRAM limits

**For Effective LongCat-Video Generation:**

1. **Be Specific About Mood:**
   - Include emotional descriptors: "unsettling," "eerie," "tense," "mysterious"
   - Specify atmosphere: "foggy," "dimly lit," "shadows," "moonlight"

2. **Describe Camera Movement:**
   - "slow pan," "tracking shot," "dolly push-in," "zoom out"
   - "handheld shaky," "smooth glide," "static composition"

3. **Lighting Direction:**
   - "backlit," "rim lighting," "single light source," "flickering"
   - "dramatic shadows," "high contrast," "low-key lighting"

4. **Duration Hints:**
   - "slow motion," "time-lapse," "real-time pace"
   - Helps model understand temporal dynamics

5. **Avoid Explicit Content:**
   - Focus on atmosphere and implication rather than graphic content
   - Use shadow, silhouette, and off-screen implications
   - Age-appropriate for 10-30 audience (no gore, explicit violence)

6. **Combine Multiple Elements:**
   - Setting + Action + Mood + Camera Movement
   - Example: "Abandoned house interior + door slowly opening + unsettling atmosphere + slow dolly forward"

### Age-Appropriate Content Guidelines

**For 10-14 Age Group:**
- Focus on mystery and mild suspense
- Avoid graphic or disturbing imagery
- Use shadows and implication over explicit visuals
- Keep tone more "Goosebumps" than "The Conjuring"

**For 15-18 Age Group:**
- Can handle more intense suspense
- Psychological horror over graphic content
- Social horror (isolation, betrayal) resonates well
- Still avoid explicit violence or gore

**For 19-30 Age Group:**
- More sophisticated atmospheric horror
- Complex emotional narratives
- True-crime aesthetic (investigation, documentary feel)
- Can be more intense but still tasteful

### Platform-Specific Prompt Adjustments

**TikTok (Fast-Paced, High Impact):**
- Shorter generations (5-10 seconds)
- Quick camera movements
- High visual contrast
- Immediate hook in first frame

**YouTube Shorts (Story-Focused):**
- Slightly longer (10-20 seconds)
- More narrative flow
- Smooth transitions
- Educational/explanatory elements
