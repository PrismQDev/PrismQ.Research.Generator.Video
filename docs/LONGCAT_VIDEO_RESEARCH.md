### Optimization for High-End GPUs (RTX 5090 and Similar)

For users with high-end consumer GPUs like the RTX 5090, here are optimization tips to maximize performance:

**Memory Optimization:**
- **Use FP16 or Mixed Precision**: Reduces VRAM usage significantly while maintaining quality
  ```bash
  # Add --fp16 flag to demo scripts (if supported)
  torchrun run_demo_text_to_video.py --checkpoint_dir=./weights/LongCat-Video --enable_compile --fp16
  ```
- **Adjust Batch Size**: Start with batch size 1, increase if VRAM allows
- **Frame Count Control**: Begin with 128 frames at 720p, scale up based on available memory

**Performance Optimization:**
- **Enable Compile Flag**: Always use `--enable_compile` for optimized kernels (as shown in examples above)
- **FlashAttention-2**: Ensure FlashAttention-2 is properly installed for maximum speed
- **CUDA Streams**: Leverage CUDA 12.4+ features for better parallelization

**Resolution and Quality:**
- **720p Recommended**: Start with 720p (1280×720) for optimal speed/quality balance
- **Vertical Video**: For 9:16 vertical format (1080×1920), monitor VRAM usage carefully
- **Upscaling Strategy**: Generate at 720p, then upscale using separate tools if needed

**Common VRAM Guidelines (RTX 5090 with 32GB VRAM):**
- 720p × 128 frames: ~12-16GB VRAM
- 720p × 256 frames: ~20-24GB VRAM
- 1080×1920 × 128 frames: ~18-22GB VRAM
- 1080×1920 × 256 frames: May exceed VRAM, use tiling/chunking

**Troubleshooting VRAM Issues:**
- Reduce spatial resolution (e.g., 640×360 or 720×1280)
- Decrease frame count per generation
- Explore latent upscaling techniques
- Use gradient checkpointing (if available)

# Example integration pattern
from src.pipeline import VideoPipeline
from src.config import GenerationConfig
import longcat_video_api  # Hypothetical integration

# Generate base content with LongCat-Video
base_video = longcat_video_api.generate(
    prompt="Abstract flowing particles in neon colors",
    duration=30,
    resolution=(720, 1280)
)

# Apply PrismQ optimizations
config = GenerationConfig(
    output_resolution=(1080, 1920),  # Resize to 9:16
    fps=30,
    target_duration=27,
)

pipeline = VideoPipeline(config)
optimized_video = pipeline.apply_engagement_optimization(
    base_video,
    captions=[("Check this out!", 0), ("Amazing!", 120)]
)
```

**Processing Pipeline**:
1. Use LongCat-Video for realistic base generation
2. Apply PrismQ's visual style processing
3. Add PrismQ's motion effects
4. Render PrismQ's overlay system
5. Export with platform-specific optimizations

### 4. Content-Specific Workflow: Horror/True-Crime Vertical Shorts

**Target Audience**: U.S. girls/women ages 10-30  
**Platform**: TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts  
**Format**: 9:16 vertical (1080×1920)

**Workflow Integration:**

```
Script/Voiceover → LongCat-Video (Text-to-Video) → PrismQ Optimization → Platform Upload
```

**Content Creation Examples:**

1. **Text-to-Video for Scene Generation:**
   ```bash
   # Generate 5-10 second horror scene
   Prompt: "A slow pan shot of an abandoned hallway with flickering lights, 
   tension builds, dark atmosphere, cinematic horror style"
   
   Duration: 5-10 seconds
   Resolution: 720p (upscale to 1080×1920 for vertical)
   ```

2. **Image-to-Video for Key Moments:**
   ```bash
   # Animate concept art or keyframe
   Input: Concept art of a creepy setting
   Prompt: "Add subtle camera movement, flickering shadows, eerie atmosphere"
   
   Duration: 5-8 seconds
   Output: Animated establishing shot
   ```

3. **Video Continuation for Suspense:**
   ```bash
   # Extend existing clip for suspense build
   Input: 3-second establishing shot
   Continuation: "Continue the slow pan, shadows creep in, tension increases"
   
   Total Duration: 20-30 seconds
   Use Case: Build suspense over narrator's story
   ```

**Narrative Integration with Voiceover:**

| Narration Moment | LongCat-Video Usage | PrismQ Enhancement |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| "I turned the corner..." | Generate corner turn scene | Add micro-movement, neon edge glow |
| "...and froze" | Freeze frame with subtle movement | Pattern break (zoom pop), high contrast |
| "The door slowly opened" | Generate door opening motion | Slow zoom, eerie color grading |
| "I heard footsteps" | Generate atmospheric hallway | Parallax drift, tension-building motion |

**Vertical Format Considerations:**

- **Aspect Ratio Support**: Check LongCat-Video's native support for 9:16 aspect ratio
  - If not natively supported, generate 16:9 and crop/reframe for vertical
  - Alternative: Generate at 1:1 (square) and extend vertically
  
- **Vertical Composition Tips**:
  - Use vertical camera movements (up/down pans)
  - Frame subjects for mobile viewing (larger, centered)
  - Utilize full vertical space for atmospheric elements (ceiling to floor)

- **Post-Processing for Vertical**:
  ```python
  # Example crop/reframe workflow
  # 1. Generate at 720×1280 (9:16) or 1280×720 (crop later)
  # 2. Apply PrismQ motion and style
  # 3. Add subtitles optimized for vertical (top or bottom third)
  # 4. Export at 1080×1920 for platform upload
  ```

**Horror-Specific Visual Style:**

- **Dark Atmosphere**: Leverage LongCat-Video's realistic rendering + PrismQ's high contrast
- **Tension Building**: Use video continuation for slow-building scenes (20-30s suspense)
- **Pattern Breaks**: Sync jump scares with PrismQ's major pattern breaks (~2.7s intervals)
- **Color Palette**: Dark blues, blacks, occasional neon accents for supernatural elements

**Example Prompts for Horror Content:**

1. "A dimly lit bedroom at night, camera slowly pushes forward toward a slightly open closet door, shadows shifting, eerie atmosphere, cinematic horror"

2. "Abandoned asylum hallway, peeling paint, flickering fluorescent lights casting long shadows, slow dolly shot, atmospheric tension, found footage style"

3. "A figure standing motionless in the corner of a dark room, barely visible in shadows, slight camera shake, horror atmosphere, suspenseful"

4. "Forest at dusk, fog rolling through trees, slow pan revealing something watching from the darkness, mystery horror atmosphere, cinematic"
