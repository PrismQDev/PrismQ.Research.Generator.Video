## Prompt Engineering Basics

### Key Principles for Horror Content

1. **Atmosphere Over Action**: Focus on tension, mood, and subtle details
2. **Slow Movement**: Use "slow", "gradual", "creeping" camera movements
3. **Lighting**: Emphasize "dim", "shadowy", "flickering", "moonlit"
4. **Detail Specificity**: Include textures, colors, environmental details
5. **Cinematic Style**: Reference "found footage", "horror film", "cinematic"

### Prompt Structure Template

```
[LOCATION/SETTING] + [LIGHTING/ATMOSPHERE] + [CAMERA MOVEMENT] + [EMOTIONAL TONE] + [STYLE REFERENCE]
```

**Example:**
```
An abandoned asylum hallway, dimly lit by flickering fluorescent lights, slow dolly 
shot moving forward, eerie atmosphere building tension, cinematic horror style
```

### Tips for Vertical Format (9:16)

- Emphasize **vertical composition**: "tall doorway", "staircase going up/down", "vertical window"
- Use **vertical camera movements**: "pan up", "pan down", "tilt up slowly"
- Frame subjects **centered** or using **rule of thirds** for mobile viewing
- Consider **full-frame elements**: floor to ceiling shots, tall trees, building facades

## Advanced Techniques

### Layering Multiple Prompts for Longer Content

For 20-30 second videos, generate 2-3 clips and stitch:

**Clip 1** (0-10s): Establishing shot
```
Wide shot of abandoned house exterior at dusk, overgrown yard and broken windows, 
slow push toward the front door, ominous atmosphere, horror film style
```

**Clip 2** (10-20s): Interior transition
```
Inside the abandoned house, hallway with peeling wallpaper, slow tracking shot 
moving deeper into the house, building tension, found footage aesthetic
```

**Clip 3** (20-30s): Climax/reveal
```
Close-up of a door at the end of the hallway, slow zoom in, door slightly ajar 
with darkness beyond, maximum tension, horror atmosphere
```

### Adjusting Prompts for Engagement Optimization

**Standard Prompt**:
```
Dark forest at night, slow pan
```

**Engagement-Optimized Prompt** (for PrismQ integration):
```
Dense dark forest at twilight with fog rolling through the trees, slow pan from 
left to right revealing shadowy figures barely visible between the trunks, branches 
swaying slightly in unfelt wind, tension building throughout the shot, atmospheric 
horror with high contrast between moonlit fog and deep shadows, cinematic composition 
with neon-blue moonlight accents, vertical framing emphasizing tall trees
```

**Optimizations Added**:
- High contrast lighting (PrismQ principle)
- Specific color accent (neon-blue)
- Movement details (swaying branches = constant motion)
- Vertical composition specification
- Extended descriptive detail for better quality

between light and shadow, simple composition perfect for text overlay, horror 
TikTok aesthetic, vertical framing, 5 seconds
```

### Instagram Reels (9:16, 15-90 seconds)

**Focus**: Aesthetic quality, smooth transitions, Instagram-friendly colors

ornate window creating dramatic shadows, slow cinematic pan, polished horror 
aesthetic, vertical composition, Instagram-ready color grading
```

### YouTube Shorts (9:16, up to 60 seconds)

**Focus**: Story-driven, slightly longer clips, narrative coherence

## Example: Complete Content Creation Workflow

### Target: 30-second Horror Story for TikTok

**Story Script**:
```
"I heard scratching in my walls every night. (0-5s)
One night, I decided to investigate. (5-10s)
I followed the sound to my bedroom. (10-20s)
What I found still haunts me today. (20-30s)"
```

**Video Generation Prompts**:

**Clip 1 (0-5s)**: Hook/Intro
```
Close-up of terrified face in dim bedroom light, eyes wide listening to off-screen 
sound, subtle head movement tracking sound, found footage horror style, high contrast, 
vertical framing, 5 seconds
```

**Clip 2 (5-10s)**: Action
```
First-person POV walking through dark hallway with flashlight, beam sweeping walls, 
following scratching sound, handheld movement, building tension, vertical composition, 
5 seconds
```

**Clip 3 (10-20s)**: Approach
```
Bedroom door from hallway perspective, scratching sound coming from inside, slow 
push toward door, hand reaching for doorknob in frame, maximum tension, horror 
atmosphere, vertical door framing, 10 seconds
```

**Clip 4 (20-30s)**: Climax/Reveal
```
Dark bedroom interior revealed as door opens, slow pan to wall where scratching 
originates, wall damage visible, something moving in the wall, peak horror moment, 
found footage style, vertical composition, 10 seconds
```

**Post-Processing**:
1. Stitch clips together in video editor
2. Apply PrismQ engagement optimizations (contrast, subtle motion)
3. Add text overlays (narration as captions)
4. Add subtle sound design
5. Export at 1080Ã—1920, 30fps

## Ethical Considerations for True Crime Content

When creating true crime content:

1. **Respect Victims**: Avoid graphic content, maintain dignity
2. **Factual Accuracy**: Ensure prompts reflect factual scenarios
3. **Content Warnings**: Label disturbing content appropriately
4. **Age Appropriate**: Consider your 10-30 age demographic
5. **Platform Guidelines**: Follow TikTok, Instagram, YouTube policies

**Avoid**:
- Graphic violence depictions
- Disrespectful victim portrayal
- Exploitation of tragedy
- Sensationalism over truth

**Recommended**:
- Atmospheric mood-setting
- Educational context
- Respectful reenactments
- Focus on mystery/investigation aspect
