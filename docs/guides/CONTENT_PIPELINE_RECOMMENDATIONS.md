## Frame Rate Strategy

### 30fps vs 60fps Decision Matrix

**Use 30fps When:**
- Publishing primarily on TikTok
- Starting out (simpler workflow)
- Budget/time constrained
- Background is static/minimal motion

**Use 60fps When:**
- Publishing on YouTube Shorts
- Want competitive edge
- Have GPU for interpolation
- Fast motion in backgrounds
- Premium positioning

**Hybrid Approach:**
- Create at 30fps
- Interpolate to 60fps for YouTube
- Use 30fps version for TikTok/Instagram
- Best of both worlds

---

## Workflow Optimization

### Batching Strategy
1. Write 10-20 scripts in one session
2. Generate all audio in batch
3. Download/generate backgrounds
4. Compose 5-10 videos at once
5. Batch export overnight
6. Quality check and upload

**Time Savings:** 40-60% vs one-at-a-time

### Template System
- Save caption styles
- Create composition templates
- Preset color grades
- Export settings saved
- Brand elements ready

**Time Savings:** 30-50% per video

## Common Issues & Solutions

**Audio sync drift:**
- Use 48kHz sample rate
- Don't mix frame rates
- Use constant frame rate

**Interpolation artifacts:**
- Use RIFE instead of FFmpeg
- Start with higher quality source
- Reduce fast motion

**Caption timing off:**
- Offset captions -50 to -100ms
- Test on actual device
- Platform-specific adjustment

**File size too large:**
- Reduce bitrate
- Use H.265 codec
- Optimize audio bitrate
