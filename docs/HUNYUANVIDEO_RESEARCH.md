## Technical Architecture

### 1. 3D VAE (Variational AutoEncoder)

HunyuanVideo employs a **3D Variational AutoEncoder** as its core compression mechanism:

**Purpose**: Compress spatial and temporal information into an efficient latent space
- Instead of generating raw pixels for every frame, the model works in a compressed latent domain
- Significantly reduces computational requirements while maintaining quality
- Enables efficient processing of high-resolution, multi-frame sequences

**Advantages**:
- Lower memory footprint during generation
- Faster inference times compared to pixel-space generation
- Better temporal coherence through joint spatial-temporal encoding
- Enables higher resolution outputs (720p, 1080p)

### 2. Dual-Stream to Single-Stream Transformer

HunyuanVideo implements a sophisticated transformer architecture:

**Dual-Stream Processing**:
- **Video Token Stream**: Processes visual information and motion dynamics
- **Text Token Stream**: Processes textual prompts and semantic understanding
- Each stream operates independently initially, allowing specialized processing

**Single-Stream Fusion**:
- After separate processing, streams are fused for joint reasoning
- Enables the model to understand both textual prompts AND visual dynamics
- Creates strong alignment between text descriptions and generated video content

**Benefits**:
- Better prompt adherence and semantic understanding
- Improved visual-linguistic alignment
- More controllable generation based on detailed text descriptions
- Enhanced ability to capture complex scene descriptions

### 3. Image-to-Video (I2V) Architecture

For I2V tasks, HunyuanVideo uses dedicated workflows:

**Token Replacement Techniques**:
- Retains reference image's style and content
- Introduces motion while preserving visual characteristics
- Maintains consistency between the input image and generated video

**Capabilities**:
- Animate static images with natural motion
- Control camera movements (pan, zoom, dolly)
- Add atmospheric effects while maintaining scene composition
- Create seamless transitions from still to motion

### 4. Generation Capabilities

**Resolution Support**:
- **720p (1280×720)**: Recommended for balanced quality and performance
- **1080p (1920×1080)**: Possible with optimization (higher VRAM requirements)
- Aspect ratio flexibility for various formats (16:9, 9:16 vertical, custom)

**Duration and Frame Support**:
- Text-to-Video: Variable length, typically 3-10 seconds in single generation
- Image-to-Video: Up to 129 frames (~5 seconds at 25fps) at 720p
- Can be extended through concatenation and transition techniques

**Frame Rate**:

## Practical Workflow Example

### Complete Production Workflow: Horror Short for YouTube

**Scenario**: 27-second true crime mystery short for US female audience (16-25)

#### Step 1: Script and Scene Planning
```
Script: "In 1987, a woman disappeared from her apartment. 
         The only clue? A mysterious phone call at midnight."

Scenes:
1. Hook (0-3s): Close-up of old rotary phone
2. Setup (3-10s): Dark apartment interior
3. Tension (10-20s): POV walking through hallway
4. Payoff (20-27s): Door reveal with dramatic lighting
```

#### Step 2: HunyuanVideo Generation

**Scene 1 Prompt**:
```
"Extreme close-up on vintage rotary phone in darkness,
camera slowly pushes in, dramatic side lighting,
1980s aesthetic, suspenseful mood, cinematic"
```

**Scene 2 Prompt**:
```
"Wide shot of dimly lit 1980s apartment living room,
camera slowly pans right, evening window light,
abandoned feeling, mystery atmosphere, period accurate"
```

**Scene 3 Prompt**:
```
"POV first-person walking through dark hallway toward door,
handheld camera subtle shake, single overhead light,
suspenseful pacing, found footage style"
```

**Scene 4 Prompt**:
```
"Medium shot of apartment door slowly opening,
camera pushes forward, dramatic backlighting,
revelation moment, cinematic horror lighting"
```

**Generation Settings**:
```python
for scene in scenes:
    video = hunyuan.generate(
        prompt=scene.prompt,
        num_frames=81,  # ~3 seconds
        height=720,
        width=1280,
        guidance_scale=7.5,
        seed=scene.seed,  # For consistency
    )
```

#### Step 3: PrismQ Optimization

```python
from src.pipeline import VideoPipeline
from src.config import GenerationConfig

config = GenerationConfig(
    output_resolution=(1080, 1920),  # Vertical
    fps=30,
    
    # Horror-specific visual style
    contrast_boost=1.6,  # Higher for dramatic effect
    saturation_boost=1.2,  # Slightly desaturated for vintage feel
    
    # Constant motion (critical for engagement)
    micro_movement_amplitude=1.5,
    micro_zoom_range=(1.0, 1.03),
    
    # Pattern breaks (maintain attention)
    minor_break_interval=35,  # Every ~1.2s
    major_break_interval=70,  # Every ~2.3s
)

pipeline = VideoPipeline(config)

# Process each scene
for scene in generated_scenes:
    processed_scene = pipeline.apply_visual_style(scene)
    processed_scene = pipeline.apply_motion_effects(processed_scene)

# Assemble timeline
timeline = pipeline.assemble_scenes(
    scenes=processed_scenes,
    transitions="crossfade",  # Smooth, mysterious
    transition_duration=0.3,  # Quick enough to maintain pace
)
```

#### Step 4: Caption Overlay

```python
captions = [
    ("1987", 30, "fade_in"),  # Year appears
    ("A woman vanished", 90, "slide_up"),  # Establishes mystery
    ("One clue remained", 300, "slide_up"),  # Builds tension
    ("A phone call at midnight", 510, "slide_up"),  # Payoff
]

final_video = pipeline.add_captions(
    timeline,
    captions,
    style="horror_subtitle",  # White text, slight glow, readable
    position="lower_third",
)
```

#### Step 5: Export and Upload

```python
final_video.export(
    path="output/1987_mystery_v1.mp4",
    format="mp4",
    codec="h264",
    bitrate="10M",
    optimize_for="youtube_shorts",
)
```

**Expected Results**:
- Total production time: ~30-45 minutes (mostly generation)
- Output quality: High-quality, engagement-optimized
- Platform-ready: Perfect for YouTube Shorts upload
- Cost: Electricity only (no licensing, no actors)
