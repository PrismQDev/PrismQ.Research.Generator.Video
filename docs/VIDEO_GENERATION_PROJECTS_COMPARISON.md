- ⚠️ More technical setup required

---

**❌ Not Recommended for 2-3 Minutes:**

**AnimateDiff:**
- Limited to very short clips (2-5 seconds typical)
- Not designed for extended temporal consistency
- Better for short loops only

**Stable Video Diffusion:**
- Optimized for short clips
- Struggles with long-form generation
- Better alternatives available

**CogVideoX:**
- Max practical duration: ~10-15 seconds
- Not optimized for minute-long generation
- Better for image-to-video short clips

---

#### Practical Workflow Recommendations

**For Best Quality (Commercial Projects):**

1. **Use HunyuanVideo** as primary generator
2. Generate in 60-90 second chunks with overlapping frames
3. Use transition blending for seamless stitching
4. Apply PrismQ engagement optimizations post-generation
5. Export at 30 FPS (smoother, smaller file size)

**For Fast Iteration (Content Creation):**

1. **Use LTX Video** for 60-second segments
2. Plan content in 3 distinct acts/sections
3. Generate each with consistent seed/style parameters
4. Stitch with crossfade transitions (1-2s)
5. Apply PrismQ effects uniformly across all segments
6. Export at 30 FPS for platform compatibility

**For Custom Requirements (Agency/Research):**

1. **Use Open-Sora** and fine-tune on your content
2. Train on 2-3 minute samples in your style
3. Use progressive generation with consistency checks
4. Manual review and correction between segments
5. Apply PrismQ pipeline for engagement boost
6. Test both 30 and 60 FPS for platform performance

---

#### Frame Rate Considerations (30 vs 60 FPS)

**30 FPS (Recommended):**
- ✅ Native support across all models
- ✅ Smaller file sizes (50% of 60 FPS)
- ✅ Faster generation times
- ✅ Better platform compatibility (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram)
- ✅ Sufficient smoothness for most content
- ✅ Lower bandwidth for viewers

**60 FPS (Advanced Use Cases):**
- ✅ Ultra-smooth motion (sports, gaming, action)
- ✅ Better slow-motion capabilities
- ✅ Premium feel for high-end content
- ⚠️ Double the frames (double the processing)
- ⚠️ Not all models natively support 60 FPS
- ⚠️ Larger file sizes (poor for mobile)
- ⚠️ Many platforms downsample to 30 FPS anyway

**Verdict**: Use 30 FPS unless you have specific requirements for 60 FPS. Most platforms and AI models optimize for 30 FPS, and viewers rarely notice the difference on mobile devices.

#### Integration with PrismQ Pipeline

For 2-3 minute vertical videos, apply PrismQ optimizations strategically:

**Segmented Application:**
```python
# Process long video in chunks for PrismQ effects
chunk_duration = 30  # Process 30s at a time
total_duration = 180  # 3 minutes

for i in range(0, total_duration, chunk_duration):
    chunk = extract_chunk(base_video, start=i, duration=chunk_duration)
    
    # Apply PrismQ optimizations
    optimized_chunk = pipeline.process_external_video(
        chunk,
        apply_visual_style=True,  # High contrast, neon edges
        apply_motion_effects=True,  # Micro-movements, pattern breaks
        pattern_break_interval=45,  # Every 1.5s
        captions=get_captions_for_chunk(i, chunk_duration)
    )
    
    output_chunks.append(optimized_chunk)

final_video = stitch_chunks(output_chunks)
```

**Key Optimizations for Long-Form:**
- Pattern breaks every 1.5-2.5 seconds (maintain engagement)
- Caption transitions at natural story beats
- Progress bar showing overall position (important for 2-3 min)
- Micro-zoom progression across entire duration (100% → 105% over 3 minutes)
- Consistent color grading throughout

---

#### Cost and Time Estimates

**HunyuanVideo (A100 GPU):**
- Generation time: 20-40 minutes per 3-minute video
- GPU cost: $2-4 per video (cloud GPU rental)
- Quality: Highest
- Best for: Final production

### Scene-by-Scene Generation Strategy (Max 20 Seconds Per Scene)

**Question**: What about generating segment-by-segment or per-scene? What if each scene is max 20 seconds?

This is actually the **most practical approach** for 2-3 minute videos, especially for local generation. Here's why and how:

#### Why 20-Second Scenes Make Sense

**Optimal for Quality:**
- ✅ Most models excel at 10-20 second clips

**Production Workflow:**
- ✅ Natural content structure (introduction → development → conclusion)
- ✅ Align with story beats in narration
- ✅ Easy to A/B test different scene variations
- ✅ Parallel generation possible (multiple GPUs)

**Mathematics:**
- 2 minutes = 120 seconds = 6 scenes × 20 seconds
- 3 minutes = 180 seconds = 9 scenes × 20 seconds
- Each scene: 600 frames at 30 FPS (manageable)

#### Scene Planning for 2-3 Minute Videos

**Example Structure (3-minute video, 9 scenes × 20s):**

| Scene | Duration | Content Type | Purpose |
|-------|----------|--------------|---------|
| 1 | 0-20s | Hook | Grab attention, introduce topic |
| 2 | 20-40s | Context | Set up the story/situation |
| 3 | 40-60s | Development 1 | First key point |
| 4 | 60-80s | Development 2 | Second key point |
| 5 | 80-100s | Climax Build | Tension/interest peaks |
| 6 | 100-120s | Climax | Main revelation/payoff |
| 7 | 120-140s | Resolution 1 | Begin wrapping up |
| 8 | 140-160s | Resolution 2 | Complete the story |
| 9 | 160-180s | CTA/Outro | Call-to-action, credits |

**Prompt Consistency Strategy:**

```python
# Base style prompt (consistent across all scenes)
base_style = "cinematic lighting, high contrast, vibrant neon accents, dark background, 4k quality"

# Scene-specific prompts
scene_prompts = [
    f"Opening hook: mysterious portal opening, {base_style}",
    f"Wide shot: futuristic cityscape at night, {base_style}",
    f"Close-up: glowing technology interface, {base_style}",
    # ... etc for each scene
]

# Use same LoRA/seed range for consistency
for i, prompt in enumerate(scene_prompts):
    generate_scene(
        prompt=prompt,
        seed=base_seed + i * 50,  # Slight variation
        lora_strength=0.8  # Consistent style
    )
```

---

#### Transition Strategies Between 20-Second Scenes

**1. Crossfade (Smoothest, 0.5-1s)**
```python
transition_config = {
    "type": "crossfade",
    "duration": 0.5,  # Half second blend
    "ease": "cubic"  # Smooth curve
}
```

**2. Hard Cut (Energetic, 0s)**
```python
# No transition, instant cut
# Works well if scenes are visually distinct
transition_config = {"type": "cut"}
```

**3. Motion Match (Advanced)**
```python
# Match motion direction at cut point
transition_config = {
    "type": "motion_match",
    "analyze_frames": 10,  # Last 10 frames of scene
    "match_direction": True
}
```

**4. Pattern Break (PrismQ Style)**
```python
# Align transition with pattern break
# Use zoom pop or rotation at scene change
transition_config = {
    "type": "pattern_break",
    "effect": "zoom_pop",  # or "rotation", "flash"
    "intensity": 1.2
}
```
