Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on video editing.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,200
Today we'll learn about keyframe generation for mobile platforms.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,000
This technique works perfectly on TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,200
First, let's understand what keyframes actually are.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,000
Keyframes mark important transition points in your video timeline.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,500
They help maintain viewer attention and improve retention rates.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,800
Now, let's look at the scene-based approach.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,500
Each scene should be between 10 and 20 seconds for optimal engagement.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,200
This prevents viewer fatigue while maintaining narrative flow.

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,500
Next, we need to select appropriate transitions between scenes.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,200
Crossfades work well for related content with smooth flow.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,000
Use dip to black for major topic changes or dramatic shifts.

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,200
The third step is optimizing for mobile-first consumption.

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,000
Always render in 9:16 vertical format at 1080 by 1920 pixels.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,500
This ensures perfect display on mobile devices.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,800
However, you might need to adapt content for different platforms.

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,500
YouTube prefers 16:9 landscape which can be letterboxed from vertical.

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,200
Facebook and Instagram also support square 1:1 format.

19
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,500
Finally, let's talk about encoding specifications.

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,200
Use H.264 codec with yuv420p pixel format for universal compatibility.

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,000
Set frame rate to 30 fps and GOP size to 60 frames.

22
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,200
The fifth important point is transition timing.

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,000
Keep transitions between 0.3 and 0.7 seconds for best results.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,500
Too fast feels jarring, too slow loses viewer attention.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,800
Lastly, always test your videos on actual mobile devices.

26
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,500
What looks good on desktop might not work well on phones.

27
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,200
Check transitions, text readability, and overall flow.

28
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,500
Now you have all the tools to create engaging mobile videos.

29
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,200
Remember to focus on retention and viewer experience.

30
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,000
Start with your SRT subtitles and let the content guide the structure.

31
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,200
